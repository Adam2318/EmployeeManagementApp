# Employee Management System — Full-Stack Monorepo

A **full-stack Employee Management System** built with **ASP.NET (Web API)** and **Angular**, designed using **real-world architecture, validation, and styling best practices**.

This project demonstrates my ability to design, structure, and implement a **scalable enterprise-style application** using modern frontend and backend technologies within a **single monorepo**.
